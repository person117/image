Python program to toggle two LEDâ€™s. 

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO 
from time import sleep 
GPIO.setwarnings(False) 
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD) 
RED_LED = 14 
GREEN_LED = 15 
GPIO.setup(RED_LED, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.LOW) 
GPIO.setup(GREEN_LED, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.LOW) 
while True: 
 GPIO.output(RED_LED, True) 
 GPIO.output(GREEN_LED, False) 
 sleep(1) 
 GPIO.output(RED_LED, False) 
 GPIO.output(GREEN_LED, True) 
 sleep(1) 


*Observations on Input and Output:*
- Input: The input consists of the commands to toggle the states of the two LEDs.
- Output: The output is the state changes of the two LEDs, alternating between on and off.

*Result and Conclusion:*
- Both LEDs alternate between on and off states with a delay of 1 second between each toggle.
- This program demonstrates a simple way to control multiple LEDs simultaneously and alternate their states.
