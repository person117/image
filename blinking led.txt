*Observations on Input and Output:*
- Input: The input here is the command to turn on and off the LED by setting the GPIO pin to high and low states.
- Output: The output is the LED itself, which blinks at intervals of 1 second.

*Result and Conclusion:*
- The LED blinks on and off at intervals of 1 second, demonstrating the basic functionality of the program.
- This program can be extended and modified for more complex LED blinking patterns or integrated into larger projects.
